Algorithm to solve finding the path between two places. Every place or node is a five-letter word. There exist a path from one node to another node if the last four letter in the first node exist in the second node. The same rules applies but in the other direction if there exists a path back from the second node to the first node. The program solving the algorithm should take a query containing a starting word and a ending word, and the program will return the length of the shortest path.
